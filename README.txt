
Identity Domains Toolbox
========================
Compute 'Identity-Domains' (IDs) from behavioral data

Getting Started
---------------
The file 'IdentityDemos' includes several examples for using the code. The script mainly shows how to:
1. Compute the identity-domains and showing their behavioral correlates
2. Use pre-computed Identity-Domains to produce a map of the personality space

The code typicals runs for less than 10 secons.


Prerequisites
-------------
The code was tested on Matlab 2017a on both a Windows and MacOS machines, but should in principal work on earlier version of Matlab as well as other operating systems

Installation
------------
Just put all the code in a directory and cd to this directory
